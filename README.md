# Databricks End-to-End Project 2025

Welcome to my **Databricks End-to-End Project 2025**! ðŸš€

This repository is dedicated to exploring the latest features and best practices in Databricks, ensuring my skills stay up-to-date with the platformâ€™s constant evolution. 

I have previous experience working with Databricks in professional projects, some of which you can find in my [GitHub portfolio](https://github.com/gj-goncalvescaldas). With this project, I aimed to experiment with modern workflows, tools, and integrations to maintain a cutting-edge understanding of the Databricks ecosystem.

### What I did in this project

- Implemented an end-to-end **data pipeline** from Bronze to Silver to Gold tables using **Delta Live Tables (DLT)**.
- Cleaned and transformed data for **claims, policies, customers, telematics, and images**.
- Created aggregated and curated datasets joining claims, policies, customers, and telematics data.

This project was developed on the **Databricks Free Edition**, which has some limitations.
