# Databricks End-to-End Project 2025

Welcome to my **Databricks End-to-End Project 2025**! ðŸš€

This repository is dedicated to exploring the latest features and best practices in Databricks, ensuring my skills stay up-to-date with the platformâ€™s constant evolution. 

I have previous experience working with Databricks in professional projects, some of which you can find in my [GitHub portfolio](https://github.com/gj-goncalvescaldas). With this project, I aim to experiment with modern workflows, tools, and integrations to maintain a cutting-edge understanding of the Databricks ecosystem.

## Goal

Complete a full **end-to-end Databricks project** using the latest features and best practices **before 1 October 2025**.
